# Disk Usage Optimization

Customize the configuration settings to lower the disk requirements for your validator node {synopsis}

Blockchain database tends to grow over time, depending e.g. on block
speed and transaction amount. For Evmos, we are talking about close to
100GB of disk usage in first two weeks.

There are few configurations that can be done to reduce the required
disk usage quite significantly. Some of these changes take full effect
only when you do the configuration and start syncing from start with
them in use.

## Indexing

If you do not need to query transactions from the specific node, you can
disable indexing. On `config.toml` set

```toml
indexer = "null"
```

If you do this on already synced node, the collected index is not purged
automatically, you need to delete it manually. The index is located
under the database directory with name `data/tx_index.db/`.

## State-sync snapshots

I believe this was disabled by default on Evmos, but listing it in any
case here. On `app.toml` set

```toml
snapshot-interval = 0
```

Note that if state-sync was enabled on the network and working properly,
it would allow one to sync a new node in few minutes. But this node
would not have the history.

## Configure pruning

By default every 500th state, and the last 100 states are kept. This
consumes a lot of disk space on long run, and can be optimized with
following custom configuration:

```toml
pruning = "custom"
pruning-keep-recent = "100"
pruning-keep-every = "0"
pruning-interval = "10"
```

Configuring `pruning-keep-recent = "0"` might sound tempting, but this
will risk database corruption if the `evmosd` is killed for any reason.
Thus, it is recommended to keep the few latest states.

## Logging

By default the logging level is set to `info`, and this produces a lot of
logs. This log level might be good when starting up to see that the
node starts syncing properly. However, after you see the syncing is
going smoothly, you can lower the log level to `warn` (or `error`). On
`config.toml` set the following

```toml
log_level = "warn"
```

Also ensure your log rotation is configured properly.

## Results

Below is the disk usage after two weeks of Evmos Arsia Mons testnet. The default
configuration results in disk usage of 90GB.

```bash
5.3G    ./state.db
70G     ./application.db
20K     ./snapshots/metadata.db
24K     ./snapshots
9.0G    ./blockstore.db
20K     ./evidence.db
1018M   ./cs.wal
4.7G    ./tx_index.db
90G     .
```

This optimized configuration has reduced the disk usage to 17 GB.

```bash
17G     .
1.1G    ./cs.wal
946M    ./application.db
20K     ./evidence.db
9.1G    ./blockstore.db
24K     ./snapshots
20K     ./snapshots/metadata.db
5.3G    ./state.db
```
