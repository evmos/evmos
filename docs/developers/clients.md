# Evmos Clients

Learn about all the available services for clients {synopsis}

The Evmos supports different clients in order to support Cosmos and Ethereum transactions
and queries:

|                                                        | Description                                                                          | Default Port |

| **Cosmos REST ([gRPC-Gateway](#cosmos-grpc-gateway))** | Query or send Evmos transactions using an HTTP RESTful API                           | `9091`       |
| **Ethereum [JSON-RPC](#ethereum-json-rpc)**            | Query Ethereum-formatted transactions and blocks or send Ethereum txs using JSON-RPC | `8545`       |
| **Ethereum [Websocket](#ethereum-websocket)**          | Subscribe to Ethereum logs and events emitted in smart contracts.                    | `8586`       |
| **Tendermint [RPC](#tendermint-rpc)**                  | Subscribe to Ethereum logs and events emitted in smart contracts.                    | `26657`      |
| **Tendermint [Websocket](#tendermint-websocket)**      | Query transactions, blocks, consensus state, broadcast transactions, etc.            | `26657`      |

## Cosmos gRPC

Evmos exposes gRPC endpoints for all the integrated Cosmos SDK modules. This makes it easier for
wallets and block explorers to interact with the Proof-of-Stake logic and native Cosmos transactions and queries.

### Cosmos gRPC-Gateway (HTTP REST)

[gRPC-Gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/) reads a gRPC service definition and
generates a reverse-proxy server which translates RESTful JSON API into gRPC. With gRPC-Gateway,
users can use REST to interact the Cosmos gRPC service.

See the list of supported gRPC-Gateway API endpoints for the Evmos testnet [here](https://api.evmos.dev/).

## Ethereum JSON-RPC

<!-- TODO: Link JSON-RPC docs -->

Evmos supports most of the standard [JSON-RPC APIs](./json-rpc/server.md) to connect with existing Ethereum-compatible web3 tooling.

::: tip
Check out the list of supported JSON-RPC API [endpoints](./json-rpc/endpoints.md) and [namespaces](./json-rpc/namespaces.md).
:::

## Ethereum Websocket

<!-- TODO: Link WSS docs -->

Then, start a websocket subscription with [`ws`](https://github.com/hashrocket/ws)

```bash
# connect to tendermint websocet at port 8546 as defined above
ws ws://localhost:8546/

# subscribe to new Ethereum-formatted block Headers
> {"id": 1, "method": "eth_subscribe", "params": ["newHeads", {}]}
< {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x44e010cb2c3161e9c02207ff172166ef","id":1}
```

## Tendermint Websocket

Tendermint Core provides a Websocket connection to subscribe or unsubscribe to Tendermint ABCI events.

::: tip
For more info about the how to subscribe to events, please refer to the official [Tendermint documentation](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/subscription.html).
:::

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "subscribe",
    "id": "0",
    "params": {
        "query": "tm.event='<event_value>' AND eventType.eventAttribute='<attribute_value>'"
    }
}
```

### List of Tendermint Events

The main events you can subscribe to are:

- `NewBlock`: Contains `events` triggered during `BeginBlock` and `EndBlock`.
- `Tx`: Contains `events` triggered during `DeliverTx` (i.e. transaction processing).
- `ValidatorSetUpdates`: Contains validator set updates for the block.

::: tip
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
ðŸ‘‰ The list of events types and values for each Cosmos SDK module can be found in the [Modules Specification](./../modules/README.md) section.
Check the `Events` page to obtain the event list of each supported module on Evmos.

## CLI

Users can use the `{{ $themeConfig.project.binary }}` binary to interact directly with an Evmos node
though the CLI.

::: tip
ðŸ‘‰ To use the CLI, you will need to provide a Tendermint RPC address for the `--node` flag.
Look for a publicly available addresses for testnet and mainnet in the [Quick Connect](./connect.md) page.

::: tip
**Note:** When querying Ethereum transactions versus Cosmos transactions, the transaction hashes are different.
When querying Ethereum transactions, users need to use event query.
Here's an example with the CLI:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:26657/tx_search?query=ethereum_tx.ethereumTxHash%3D0x8d43464891fac6c113e809e14dff1a3e608eae124d629799e42ca0e36562d9d7&prove=false&page=1&per_page=30&order_by=asc" -H "accept: application/json"  
```
