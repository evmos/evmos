# Tendermint KMS

[Tendermint KMS](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/tmkms) is a key management service that allows separating key management from Tendermint nodes. In addition it provides other advantages such as:

- Improved security and risk management policies
- Unified API and support for various HSM (hardware security modules)
- Double signing protection (software or hardware based)

It is recommended that the KMS service runs in a separate physical hosts.

## Installing Tendermint KMS onto the node

You will need the following prerequisites:

- **Rust** (stable; **1.56+**): https://rustup.rs/
- **C compiler**: e.g. gcc, clang
- **pkg-config**
- **libusb** (1.0+). Install instructions for common platforms:
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev`
  - RedHat/CentOS: `yum install libusb1-devel`
  - macOS (Homebrew): `brew install libusb`

NOTE (x86_64 only): Configure `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable:
`export RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-feature=+aes,+ssse3`

We are ready to install KMS. There are 2 ways to do this: compile from source or install with Rusts cargo-install. Weâ€™ll use the first option.

Compiling from source code

The following example adds `--features=ledger` to enable Ledger  support. 
tmkms can be compiled directly from the git repository source code, using the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/iqlusioninc/tmkms.git && cd tmkms
[...]
$ cargo build --release --features=ledger
```
Alternatively, substitute `--features=yubihsm` to enable YubiHSM support.

If successful, it will produce the tmkms executable located at: ./target/release/tmkms.

## Configuration

A KMS can be configured using the following HSMs:

### Using a YubiHSM
  
Detailed information on how to setup a KMS with YubiHSM2 can be found [here](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/tmkms/blob/master/README.yubihsm.md)

### Using a Ledger device running the Tendermint app

Detailed information on how to setup a KMS with Ledger Tendermint App can be found [here](kms_ledger.md)
