# Overview

Learn about security on Evmos {synopsis}

The [Security Policy on Evmos](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/security/policy)
includes a vulnerability disclosure policy and guidelines for
reporting vulnerabilities in the Evmos ecosystem.
It explains the process for reporting and disclosing vulnerabilities through
the use of the [Immunefi Bug Bounty Program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/evmos/) and <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->
how the Evmos team handles and resolves reported vulnerabilities.
The contents of the policy help avoiding privacy violations
and keeping information confidential.
Also included are commitments from the Evmos team,
such as not pursuing legal action
and working with researchers to disclose issues in a timely manner.
The disclosure process includes steps for verifying
and confirming reported vulnerabilities,
determining their potential impact on the Evmos platform,
and patching and disclosing the vulnerability to the public.
The payment process for reported vulnerabilities is also outlined
and instructions for contacting the Evmos Security Team are provided.

Additionally, Evmos has a [Simple Arrangement for Funding Upload (SAFU)](./safu.md).
The SAFU is a simple yet extensible way to specify
a post-exploit policy for whitehats, particularly rewards and distributions.
For more information, visit the [SAFU section](./safu.md).
