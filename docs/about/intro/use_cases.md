## Point Chain

The Point Chain blockchain provides Ethereum developers to deploy their smart contracts to the
Point Chain EVM and get the benefits of a fast-finality Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain. Developers will
also benefit from highly-reliable clients from testnets can be used to test and deploy their
contracts.

Point Chain also offers built-in interoperability functionalities with other Cosmos and BFT chains by using [IBC](https://cosmos.network/ibc). Developers can also benefit from using a bridge network to enable interoperability between mainnet Ethereum and Point Chain.
