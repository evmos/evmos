# State Transitions

The `x/fees` module allows for three types of state transitions: `RegisterDevFeeInfo`, `UpdateDevFeeInfo` and `CancelDevFeeInfo`. The logic for *distributing transaction fees*, is handled through [Hooks](./05_hooks.md).

### Fee Info Registration

A developer registers a contract for receiving transaction fees, defining the contract address, an array of nonces for deriving the contract address from the EOA address deploying the contract and an optional withdraw address for sending the fees.

If the withdraw address is not set, the fees will be sent to the deployer address by default.

1. User submits a `RegisterDevFeeInfo` to register a contract address, along with a withdraw address that they would like to receive the fees to
2. The following checks must pass:
    1. `x/fees` module is enabled
    2. the contract was not previously registered
    3. deployer has a valid account (it has done at least one transaction) and is not a smart contract
    4. an account corresponding to the contract address exists, with a non-empty bytecode
    5. contract address can be derived from the deployerâ€™s address and provided nonces using the `CREATE` operation
3. An instance of the provided fee information is stored
4. All transactions sent to the registered contract occurring after registration will have their fees distributed to the developer, according to the global `DeveloperShares` parameter

### Fee Info Update

A developer updates the withdraw address for a registered contract, defining the contract address and the new withdraw address.

1. User submits a `UpdateDevFeeInfo`
2. The following checks must pass:
    1. `x/fees` module is enabled
    2. the contract is registered
    3. the signer of the transaction is the same as the contract deployer
3. The fee information is updated with the new withdraw address.
4. The developer receives the fees from transactions occurring after this update, on the new withdraw address

### Fee Info Cancel

A developer cancels receiving fees for a registered contract, defining the contract address.

1. User submits a `CancelDevFeeInfo`
2. The following checks must pass:
    1. `x/fees` module is enabled
    2. the contract is registered
    3. the signer of the transaction is the same as the contract deployer
3. The fee information is removed from storage
4. The developer no longer receives fees from transactions sent to this contract
