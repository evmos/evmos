# State Transitions

## ABCI

### End Block

The ABCI EndBlock checks if the airdrop has ended in order to process the clawback of unclaimed tokens.

1. Check if the airdrop has concluded. This is the case if:
    - the global flag is enabled
    - the current block time is greater than the airdrop end time
2. Clawback tokens from the escrow account that holds the unclaimed tokens by transferring its balance to the community pool
3. Clawback tokens from empty user accounts by transferring the balance from empty user accounts with claims records to the community pool if:
    - the account is an ETH account
    - the account is not a vesting account
    - the account has a sequence number of 0, i.e. no transactions submitted, and
    - the balance amount is the same as the dust amount sent in genesis
    - the account does not have any other balances on other denominations except for the claims denominations.
4. Prune all the claim records from the state
5. Disable any further claim by setting the global parameter to `false`
