# `epochs`

## Abstract

Often in the SDK, we would like to run certain code every-so often. The purpose of `epochs` module is to allow other modules to set that they would like to be signaled once every period. So another module can specify it wants to execute code once a week, starting at UTC-time = x. `epochs` creates a generalized epoch interface to other modules so that they can easily be signalled upon such events.
